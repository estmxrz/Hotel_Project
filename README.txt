Hello! Thank you for letting me work on this coding exercise! It was definitely a challenge since I haven't worked with JSON files in a couple of years, but it was fun!

--FIRST!--
Below are the steps on running the program:
1. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code
2. Open Main.cs
3. Run the program in the terminal (type: dotnet run)
4. It'll ask for 3 prompts
5. ??? Profit

--Overview of design decisions--
Honestly, I didn't really have a design in mind, I just want to be able to get this program working. I used my notes that I had from college and used that as a guidance on what I need to get going. Then after that, I guess I just kept looking up on what I wanted to do and make small design decisions (output prompts, etc.).

--Why C#?--
At first, I REALLY hated C# due to how complicated it was, but during my last semester in college, we were working in C# nonstop. It made me appreciate the language more and I wanted to give myself a challenge... "code in the language you kinda struggle with!" Sounds silly, but I want to be able to understand in a different perspective of how different languages works. Thus, that is why I picked C#, mostly for the familiarity I'd say.

--What is your process on verifying and correcting your program?--
I sat there a lot and read through my code over and over again to make sure I'm not missing anything. I had to explain myself in elementary steps since I still struggle with understanding concepts, but I was able to pull through. What I really liked about being able to click was to go through the code again and seeing how a lot of things connect the dots. Of course, there were struggles where I wasn't sure where the issue was, but looking up a bunch of resources to help me understand why it's throwing this error here and there made me click in a way where I can keep pushing forward.

--What I wanted to get to, but didn't have time...--
I wanted to get into the GUI side since I have been brushing up my HTML and CSS skills lately. And that I also wanted to work on having the user input the correect values if they were to enter an incorrect value. In the future, I hope I can utilize my time and be able to flush out what I want to present to the audience. Like I said earlier, it's been a while since I worked with C# and JSON files (this will change as I get in more practice).

Thank you for reading this and taking the time to test my program!
